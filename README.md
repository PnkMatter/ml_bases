# ml_bases - Your Starting Point for Machine Learning

Welcome to ml_bases, a foundational repository designed to help you understand and implement core machine learning concepts. This collection provides basic, commented code examples for some of the most common algorithms, making it a great resource for anyone starting their journey in data science.

Each project uses popular datasets from the scikit-learn library, allowing you to focus on the model implementation without needing to worry about data collection.

Projects Included

  1. Linear and Logistic Regression

        **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes (for regression) and sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer (for classification).

        **Goal**: Predict continuous values (e.g., diabetes progression) or classify tumors as benign/malignant.

        **Code**: Implements LinearRegression and LogisticRegression to show the difference between regression and classification tasks.

  2. Decision Trees and Random Forest

        **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_iris.

        **Goal**: Classify Iris flowers into one of three species.

       **Code**: Compares the performance of a single DecisionTreeClassifier with an ensemble RandomForestClassifier to highlight the benefits of ensemble methods.

  3. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

       **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_wine.

        **Goal**: Classify different types of wine.

        **Code**: Uses the popular XGBClassifier to demonstrate a powerful boosting algorithm.

  4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_digits.

        **Goal**: Perform handwritten digit recognition.

        **Code**: Uses KNeighborsClassifier to classify images of digits based on their nearest neighbors.

  5. Neural Networks (MLP)

        **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_digits.

        **Goal**: Use a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

        **Code**: Implements MLPClassifier from scikit-learn as an introduction to basic neural network architecture.
