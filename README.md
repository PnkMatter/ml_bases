## Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

ðŸ”¹ Main Types of Machine Learning

  Supervised Learning â€“ The model trains on labeled data (input + known output).
  
  Tasks: Classification, Regression.
  
  Unsupervised Learning â€“ The model trains on unlabeled data, discovering patterns and structures on its own.
  
  Tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.

  Semi-Supervised Learning â€“ Uses a small amount of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data.
  
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) â€“ An agent learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

ðŸ”¹ **Common Algorithms and Methodologies**

ðŸ”¸ Regression

  Linear Regression â†’ Models linear relationships between variables (e.g., predicting house prices based on size).
  
  Logistic Regression â†’ Despite the name, used for binary classification (e.g., spam or not spam).
  
  Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net â†’ Variations of linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting.

ðŸ”¸ Distance-Based Methods

  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) â†’ Classifies or predicts based on the closest data points (e.g., product recommendation).

ðŸ”¸ Decision Trees and Ensembles

  Decision Trees â†’ Simple and interpretable tree-structured decisions.
  
  Random Forest â†’ Combines multiple decision trees for more robust predictions.
  
  Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) â†’ Sequentially improves accuracy by combining weak learners (trees).

ðŸ”¸ Probabilistic Models

  Naive Bayes â†’ Based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, often used in text classification (e.g., spam detection).
  
  Hidden Markov Models (HMM) â†’ Widely used in sequential data like speech or time series.

ðŸ”¸ Generalized Linear Models

  SVM (Support Vector Machines) â†’ Finds hyperplanes that separate data into classes.
  
  Perceptron â†’ The foundation of modern neural networks.

ðŸ”¸ Clustering (Unsupervised)

  K-Means â†’ Groups data into k clusters.
  
  DBSCAN â†’ Density-based clustering, useful for irregular shapes.
  
  Hierarchical Clustering â†’ Builds nested clusters in a tree-like structure.

ðŸ”¸ Dimensionality Reduction

  PCA (Principal Component Analysis) â†’ Reduces the number of features while preserving variance.
  
  t-SNE / UMAP â†’ Non-linear methods commonly used for data visualization.

ðŸ”¸ Neural Networks & Deep Learning

  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) â†’ Generalize non-linear relationships.
  
  CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) â†’ Specialized for image recognition and computer vision.
